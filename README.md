# QuillCTF

This repo contains my solutions that I have submitted to QuillCTF. All solutions will be updated after the challenge has been retired.

# What is QuillCTF

Quill CTF is a game in which you hack Ethereum smart contracts to learn about security. It's meant to be both fun and educational. The game is designed to educate players on how to identify and fix security issues in Ethereum smart contracts.

The challenges contain several of the most common vulnerabilities found in Ethereum smart contracts today, including reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, predictable randomness, and more!

# Getting Started

## Install & Update Foundry

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

## Clone This Repo and install dependencies

```sh
git clone git@github.com:alex0207s/QuillCTF.git
cd QuillCTF
forge install
```

## Run Test

```sh
forge test --match-contract {contract} -vvv
```

-   Replace {contract} with the actual name of the contract
-   The more 'v' characters you include, the more verbose the output becomes (up to 5 'v').
